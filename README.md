Code for Paper Trader App

This is an app I made with the help of Markit On Demand API. Since this is a free API, frequent API calls could return with empty responses.
I made this app in an effort to learn more about RecyclerViews, Intents, Services, Broadcast, etc.

Think of this as a Hello World II app. 

The gist of the app is this:
- Decide on how much paper money you'd like to invest
- Start buying or shorting stocks in order to learn about the stock market or to test out an investing strategy you may have
- You can also keep a watchlist of the hottest stocks

This app uses SQLite and internal storage, these will be erased when the app is erased, so no need to worry about dangling files. 
If interested, here's the link to the app in the store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mine.stocksimulator
